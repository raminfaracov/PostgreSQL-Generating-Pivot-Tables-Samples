What is a Pivot Table?

A pivot table is a statistics tool that summarizes and reorganizes selected columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report. The tool does not actually change the spreadsheet or database itself, it simply “pivots” or turns the data to view it from different perspectives.

Pivot tables are especially useful with large amounts of data that would be time-consuming to calculate by hand. A few data processing functions a pivot table can perform include identifying sums, averages, ranges or outliers. The table then arranges this information in a simple, meaningful layout that draws attention to key values.

Pivot table is a generic term, but is sometimes confused with the Microsoft trademarked term, PivotTable. This refers to a tool specific to Excel for creating pivot tables.

More Databases has a some functions for generating pivot tables. 
I will explain to you how to create a `PIVOT TABLE` in the PostgreSQL database.
